# Kubernetes Voting App
Source: https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app

A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

Run the following command to create the deployments and services objects:

```
$ kubectl apply -f .
deployment "db" created
service "db" created
deployment "redis" created
service "redis" created
deployment "result" created
service "result" created
deployment "vote" created
service "vote" created
deployment "worker" created
```

The vote interface is then available on port 31000 on each host of the cluster, the result one is available on port 31001.

## Architecture


![Architecture diagram](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/raw/main/architecture.excalidraw.png)



* A front-end web app in [Python](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/vote) or [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/vote/dotnet) which lets you vote between two options
* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) or [NATS](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats/) queue which collects new votes
* A [.NET Core](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/worker/src/Worker), [Java](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/worker/src/main) or [.NET Core 2.1](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/worker/dotnet) worker which consumes votes and stores them in…
* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) or [TiDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockersamples/tidb/tags/) database backed by a Docker volume
* A [Node.js](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/result) or [ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/blob/master/result/dotnet) webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

Note: The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.
